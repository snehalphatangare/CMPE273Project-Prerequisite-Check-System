#### Abstract

We have built a pre-requisite check system using Python-tesseract tool.
This check systems performs OCR on the transcript uploaded and extracts required fields from it.
The system performs student eligibilty check and stores the details in database if he satisfies the enrollment eligibility.
The system then sends an email notification to the student and professor if he/she is eligible for enrollment.
